<ul>
<li><b>In this project we performed the data transformation process </b>It requires just minor changes, such as altering data types as well as handling missing values and aggregating the data filtering the data.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>It&nbsp; includes converting categorical variables to numerical format if it is necessary And&nbsp;&nbsp;filling the data of missing values with appropriate procedure like mean or median imputation and ensuring consistency in data formats across attributes.&nbsp;</b></li>
<li><b>Additionally, We will be performing the outlier detection and </b>Remediation may be used to ensure the accuracy of data prior to analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Task Abstraction</b></h1>
<h2><b>Task: Here we are&nbsp;</b>Analyzing agricultural data&nbsp; and Global country data&nbsp;to identify trends and patterns for various attributes</h2>
<h2><b>Target: Here we will g</b>ain insights into agricultural production, Usage of land and Literacy rate, percentage of total population etc.</h2>
<h2><b>Actions:</b></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Data Collection</b></li>
<li>Data cleaning and preprocessing.</li>
<li>Visualization of agricultural and Global Country Data Utilizing Python</li>
<li>We will create interactive Dashboards for various trends and patterns utilizing powerBi.</li>
<li>Correlation analysis between agricultural and Global Country data.</li>
<li>We employ D3.js to demonstrate the visualizations with interactive on the web</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Task Abstraction-Workflow Explanation</b></h1>
<ul>
<li>The workflow starts with data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the quality of the data for analysis.</li>
<li>Then, we moves on to visualize agricultural metrics to understand trends and patterns in agricultural production.</li>
<li>After that, we explores demographic variables to gain insights into the population characteristics.</li>
<li>Then we performs correlation analysis to uncover relationships between agricultural and demographic factors.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Implementation using Tools:<b>
</b></h1>
<h2><b>D3.js:</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>We used the D3.js to visual the initial data which was not cleaned and D3.js has provided a stage to create interactive charts and graphs directly in the web browsers.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Usage: By using the D3.js we explored the patterns and relations present in the dataset by creating various visualizations such as bar chart, scatterplots etc.</li>
<h2><b>Python:</b></h2>
<li>Python is used mainly for the data pre-processing and various libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to understand and visualize the data.</li>
<li>Usage: For the data pre-processing the pandas and bumpy libraries were used and they also handled all the inconsistencies present in the data and all the visualizations were created with the help of Matplotlib and Seaborn on the data which was cleaned, through this we were able to present the valuable insights through a number of charts and plots each with its own insight about the agricultural sector.</li>
<h2><b>Microsoft Power BI:</b></h2>
<li>We used the Power BI mainly to create interactive dashboards which would have different visualizations such as maps, plots and charts. And then by using Power BI these different sets of data could be connected which gives a more complete picture of what’s happening.</li>
<li>Usage: By using Power BI we integrated various visualizations and also created relationships between them. By integrating the visualizations we can see how they interact when a change is made on one visualization and observe its effect on the other visualization and vice-versa, so by this we can gain a deeper understanding of the data.</li>

<h2><b>Explanation: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li>The association between urban population and agricultural land use measures, such as total crop area, total crop output, and average crop yield, is depicted in this scatter plot.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Agricultural land use patterns may vary as urbanization increases as a result of adjustments to labor force, economic priorities, and land availability.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Comprehending these patterns is essential for environmentally conscious agricultural and urban planning, guaranteeing that urban expansion does not jeopardize environmental sustainability or food security.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Visualizing Using Python and Its Libraries:</h1>
<h2><b>Population Density vs. Agricultural Productivity:</b></h2>
<h2><b>Explanation: </b></h2>
